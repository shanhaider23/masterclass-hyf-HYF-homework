# Flipped classroom

## What is this masterclass about?

C# is one of the most common used programming languages used today. It can be used to build a large variety of applications: web, mobile, desktop and even games.

To use C# to build applications, you will need .NET. Think of it as a Swiss knife for building applications. It includes a lot of functionality out of the box and gives your program super powers.

Since C#/.NET is a large ecosystem, we will start lightly and introduce you to the language by writing simple console programs. Our next and final target will be building a simple Web API using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core - a framework used to build web applications.

## What will you get out of the masterclass?

After finishing this masterclass you will have basic understanding of C# and .NET. You will also understand how to build a basic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core application.

ðŸ“šÂ The curriculum includes the following topics:

- Introduction to C# and .NET
- Connecting to database to change and retrieve data
- Creating and running a simple web application using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core

## The structure of the masterclass

The masterclass follows the flipped classroom approach. This means that students are learning about the topic at home before coming to the classroom. In the classroom we will practice and discuss the topics in more detail.

Homework will be included in some sessions. While it isnâ€™t mandatory, it is still highly recommended. After all, practice makes perfect.

You are required to have a laptop or a personal computer for writing and running code.

## How to get started

ðŸŽ‰Â We are excited to have you onboard. Start by installing .NET on your machine:

- Go to [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Click on download .NET SDK x64 button
